## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This exercise let me improve my kknowledge of flexbox and styles. Now, I think I will use more grid insted of flexbox in order to practice.

I had problems adding border-radious in the main section. I dont know why but at main there was no way to insert radious in the border. I only could make it adding border-top-left-radious, border-bottom-right-radious, etc.


### Continued development

In the future projects I want to use SASS and GULP because I tool a little course about it. Besides, I need to use more CSS Grid insted of flexbox.
